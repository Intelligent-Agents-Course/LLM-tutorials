    "\n",
    "Let's say you have 10 blocks and a table. Each block can be:\n",
    "- On the table\n",
    "- On top of another block\n",
    "- Clear (nothing on top)\n",

    "State 2: A on table, B on table, C on B, D on A...\n",

    "Classical search breaks. You can't store a billion states in memory. You can't compute heuristics for each one. You can't even enumerate them.\n",

    "Here's what's wasteful: Most things DON'T CHANGE when you move a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pick up Block A and move it to Block B, you don't need to re-specify:\n",
